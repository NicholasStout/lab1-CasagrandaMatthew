## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{gapminder_5060 <- read_csv("gapminder-5060.csv")}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
us <- gapminder_5060 %>% filter(country == "United States")
plot(x=us$year, y=us$gdpPercap, 
     type = 'l', xlab = "year", ylab = "gdpPercap")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
